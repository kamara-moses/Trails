# Trails

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This websites was created to allow the user simple access to the top 5 hikes within a certian area. The user simply put in the name of a city, (USA, state may need to be included if there are multiple cities with that name) then the top 5 hikes near that city will be shown. THe user will see the name of the trail, a 1 to 5 star rating of that trail the location and the summary of the trail. Lastly there is a link to hiking project.com that shows a map of the trail.

We used a geolocation api https://opencagedata.com/api to pass the location of the user input of our search bar into the other api we leveraged

We took the the geolocation and passed it into our hiking api https://www.hikingproject.com/data and that allowed us to call up the hikes near that city based on its latitude and longitude.

<h2>Difficulties</h2>

Creating this project presented us with several difficulties in it duration. We encountered time schedule differences that we had to work around due to everyone having a different schedules. Each one had to give there availability and we had to work around those time. Once we figure out the schedule to have time to work on the project together, things become easier. Also, we faced the dreaded API call issues that stumped us for sometime, luckily we had some practice that kept us going and struggle through it. It was a learning curve for us definitely. Overall, I believe this project definitely challenged our knowledge and grit as developers working in a team.

<h2>Contributions and Modification</h2>

We will continue to add to this application, we want to expand it reach. We are only able to access certain information with the API call. We will like to add other pertinent information that the user can access and utilized in their search.

We are open to contributions from any who notice where the application needs to improve. If you want to contribute feel free to create a pull request.
